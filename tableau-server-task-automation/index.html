            <p>
                As a Tableau Server admin, sometimes you’re stuck doing manual tasks
                or fixing problems that you already know the answer to……and that's not particularly engaging, when all
                you really want to do is watch some videos of cats (oh dear god, no NOT the movie) or compilations of
                Russian drivers randomly crashing into each other for no apparent reason.
            </p>
            <p>
                Luckily, there is a solution. This series is about how you too can spend more time watching internet
                memes, instead of administering Tableau Server - via the magic of automation. There are automation
                options for many different aspects of Tableau Server, such as installation, monitoring, and testing.
                However, this series will focus on common tasks such as creation of projects/groups, addition of users
                to sites/group, and deployment of workbooks/datasources.

                To be begin, select an option from below - please that the assumed Tableau Server version for these tutorials is <b>2019.3</b>, but for the most part these steps should work in older/newer versions.

            <p>
                The core of what we'll be leveraging is the Tableau Server REST API - an XML based endpoint to which we
                send <b>requests</b>, and receive back <b>responses.</b>
            </p>
            <p>
                The API is documented in all its glory <a
                    href="https://help.tableau.com/current/api/rest_api/en-us/REST/rest_api_ref.htm" target="_blank">here</a> - feel
                free to follow the link and check it out.
            </p>
            <p>
                Now that you've skimmed through all 86367284 pages of that monstrosity, I'm here to tell you that we
                will <b>NOT</b> be using that page to construct XML manually - instead we'll use a nice <u>Tableau
                    supported</u> Python library, which does most of the foundation work for us - <a
                    href="https://github.com/tableau/server-client-python" target="_blank">https://github.com/tableau/server-client-python</a>
            </p>
            <p>To get started using the API, we'll need to do the following: <br />
                <ol>
                    <li>Make sure you have a <b>test environment</b> OR at the very least, a <b>test site</b> for Tableau
                        Server - I can't stress this enough. Mucking around with the API in a production environment is
                        likely to end....badly.</li>
                    <li>Install Python as per instructions here - <a
                            href="https://www.python.org/downloads/" target="_blank">https://www.python.org/downloads/</a>. Do yourself
                        a favour and use Python3.</li>
                    <li><i>(Optional)</i> Consider setting up a Python virtual environment for your Tableau related
                        projects - <a
                            href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html" target="_blank">https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html</a>.
                        This is not required but is generally a very good habit to get into when working with Python.
                    </li>
                    <li>Install the tableauserverclient Python library as per instructions here - <a
                            href="https://tableau.github.io/server-client-python/docs/" target="_blank">https://tableau.github.io/server-client-python/docs/</a>
                    </li>
                </ol>

        <div class="pt-5" id="apiIntro">
            <p class="lead">Logging in and getting basic information via Tableau Server API</p>
            <p>Now that we have everything installed, its time to start playing with the API on our <b>TEST</b> Tableau
                    Server environment/site.<br/><br/>
                    To login, we can follow the documentation <a
                        href="https://tableau.github.io/server-client-python/docs/sign-in-out" target="_blank">here</a>. We'll keep it simple and use user/pass to login instead of dealing with Personal Access Tokens.
                <pre><code>
                    import tableauserverclient as TSC
    
                    tableau_auth = TSC.TableauAuth('USERNAME', 'PASSWORD', site_id=`SITENAME`)
                    server = TSC.Server('https://SERVER_URL')

                    # sets the correct API version for your version of server
                    # without this it defaults to a very old version
                    server.use_server_version()

                    # sign in here
                    server.auth.sign_in(tableau_auth)

                    # do what you want to do
                    my_amazing_function_to_automate_everything(server)    

                    # sign out when you're done
                    server.auth.sign_out()           
                </code></pre>
            </p>
            <p>
                Now that we're signed in, we can start sending requests to Tableau Server. For instance, we can get a list of all users on our site by running this:
                <pre><code>
                    # get all the users
                    all_users = TSC.Pager(server.users)

                    # do stuff for each user
                    for user in all_users:
                        if user.name == 'joe'
                            print(user.site_role)
                </code></pre>
                The key part here is the <code>server.users</code> - each resource such as <i>projects</i>, <i>groups</i>, etc. has an equivalent similar to this. So if instead we were to get a list of all other resources, we could run code as below:
                <pre><code>
                    # get all groups
                    all_groups = TSC.Pager(server.groups) 

                    # get all projects
                    all_projects = TSC.Pager(server.projects) 

                    # get all published datasources
                    all_ds = TSC.Pager(server.datasources) 
                </code></pre>
                Now that we know how to get a <b>collection</b> of everything, it becomes fairly straight forward to get a  <b>specific</b> user/group/any resource from that collection. We just need to filter it out based on what makes it unique within the site (e.g. User ID for users, group name for groups, project name + workbook name for a workbook, etc).
                <pre><code>
                    # get all groups
                    all_groups = TSC.Pager(server.groups)
                    
                    # filter out the group name we're looking for
                    # using the assumption that group name is unique in our site
                    for group in groups:
                        if group.name == 'My Group':
                            my_group = group
                            break # this just exits the for loop since we've found what we're looking for
                </code></pre>
                <b>NOTE:</b> You can also filter individual items using RequestOptions as shown here - <a href="https://tableau.github.io/server-client-python/docs/filter-sort">https://tableau.github.io/server-client-python/docs/filter-sort</a>. As of TSC v9.0, using RequestOptions does have some caveats around searching special characters (you'll need to urlencode the search parameters). 
                <br/> <br/>
                BUT it's a more efficient method of filtering, so you should definitely considering using it once you're more familiar with the API.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="pt-5" id="manageUsers">
            <p class="lead">User/Group Management</p>
            <p>
                Since the recommended way to manage project permissions (which you should be locking at project level by the way) is via adding users to groups, and groups can only be modified by Server/Site admins, there's a good chance that you'll be stuck managing this tedious process.
            </p>
            <p>
                Thankfully, it's fairly simple via the API to manage users and groups. The following code is based on the reference material <a href="https://tableau.github.io/server-client-python/docs/api-ref#users">here</a> and <a href="https://tableau.github.io/server-client-python/docs/api-ref#groups">here</a>.

                    # we could just as easily do the reverse, and remove the user from the group

                While creating a new project and group is straight forward, as of TSC v0.9 you <b>CANNOT</b> set the default project permissions via the Python API. This is a shame because that's probably the most time consuming part - however, it's not as difficult as you might think to write your own functions to get around this problem (I'll talk about this in the <i>Getting around the limitations</i> section).
